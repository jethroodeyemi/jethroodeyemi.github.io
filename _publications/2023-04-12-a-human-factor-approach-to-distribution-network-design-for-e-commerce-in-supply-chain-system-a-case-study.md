Distribution network for e-commerce is an important supply chain (SC) networks required for effective management of warehousing. Due to the recent disruption in the SC, minimal lead times for product delivery days can no longer be guaranteed, thereby causing an increase in distribution and delivery of goods. This paper investigated some human factors (HFs) to understand the root cause of the ongoing disruption in the SC system using statistical and exploratory data analysis. The findings revealed that HFs has a huge significance in a distribution system. To our best knowledge, these findings are seldom reported in literature of e-commerce systems.
