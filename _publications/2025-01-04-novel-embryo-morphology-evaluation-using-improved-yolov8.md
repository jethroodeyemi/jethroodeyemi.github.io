In this study, an improved YOLOv8 object detection model (YOLOv8-C2f-CA) is proposed to automate the detection and quantification of embryonic cells, supporting embryologists in accurately assessing embryo morphology. By integrating a Coordinate Attention (CA) mechanism into the YOLOv8 architecture, our model achieved 87.8% mean average precision (mAP), 83.9% precision, and 76.4% recall, outperforming the baseline YOLOv8. The lightweight CA mechanism is incorporated into both the backbone and neck networks of YOLOv8, bolstering the modelâ€™s capacity to identify the key morphological features of embryos without substantially impacting its size or computational efficiency. This method facilitates a rapid and precise evaluation process, minimizing the need for extensive time and human resources while maintaining precise accuracy
