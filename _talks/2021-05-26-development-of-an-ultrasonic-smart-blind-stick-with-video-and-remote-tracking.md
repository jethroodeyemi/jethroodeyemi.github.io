Traditionally,  visually  impaired people  use  a  stick  to  find obstacles that  are ahead of them. This  stick is  ineffective  in  many ways thereby exposing the user  to  several challenges. This paper describes an ultrasonic blind stick with an ESP32-Cam  module  as  a form of navigation and security. The smart blind stick allows visually challenged pe ople  to navigate with ease. It uses two ultrasonic sensors to detect obstacles ahead, one attached  to the upper part of  the stick and the second installed at an inclined angle downward to sense elevated surface.  Once an obstacle is sensed, the voice  module alerts the users by playing a prerecorded  message  through  an  earphone.  It  will  also  sound  a  different  prerecorded message  when  a  water  body  is detected. The  system  has  an  integrated  feature  to help  the blind locate the  stick  if  misplaced with the aid of a  wireless RF-based remote. By pressing the remote button, the buzzer sounds this helps the blind person to locate the smart stick. As proposed, a  smart  blind  stick  with  remote  and  video  tracking functionalities  was designed and verified to be fully functional.
