 Fire  incidents  are disasters  that  can potentially  lead  to the  loss  of life  and property.  It  can  also  cause  damage  and  permanent  disability  to  the  affected  victim. Firefighters are primarily tasked to handle  fire incidents, but they are often exposed to high risks when extinguishing the fire, especially in a hazardous area. A one-stop solution for all fire-related  accidents  like  fire  outbreak,  smoke  and  combustible  gas  leakage  is  hereby considered. This study presents the development of a fire  extinguishing robot with  an SMS alert  feature  that  can  sound  an  alarm  to  occupants  of  the  building,  send  an  alert  SMS message to the registered phone number, and also proceed to extinguish the fire unmanned. It  is  designed  to  be  compact  for  ease  of  movement  into  narrow  spaces.  The  robot  is equipped  with  an  ultrasonic  sensor  to  avoid  collision  with  any  obstacle  and  surrounding objects, while the  flame  sensor  alongside a smoke sensor,  was  used to detect the fire.  This developed  autonomous  system  demonstrates  the  capabilities  of  identifying  fire  locations automatically and extinguishes the fire using the stored water in the container on it.
