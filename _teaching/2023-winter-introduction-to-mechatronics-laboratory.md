This course is designed to provide students with hands-on experience in the field of mechatronics. The course will cover the basics of mechatronics, including sensors, actuators, and microcontrollers. The course will also cover the design and implementation of mechatronic systems, including the use of software tools such as MATLAB and Simulink. The course will include a series of laboratory experiments that will allow students to apply the concepts learned in class to real-world problems.

## Lab Schedule

Six labs will be conducted in this course. The labs will cover the following topics:

- Introduction to the equipment and software to be used in the lab.
- Transistor Operation, Passive filters, and an Op-Amp circuit.
- LED Control and Interruptions.
- Stepper Motor Motion Control.
- DC Motor Speed Control Using PWM.
- Closed-Loop DC Motor Position Control.
